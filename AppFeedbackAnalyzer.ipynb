      "1. Balanced reward system: Ensure that players can progress through levels based solely on their skill and dedication, rather than monetary investment. This will help maintain a fair playing environment where everyone has an equal chance of winning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fair pricing structure: Evaluate the current in-game purchases (loot boxes, premium cards) to ensure that they do not disproportionately affect gameplay and enjoyment for those who don't want to spend money. Consider implementing a fairer monetization strategy with transparent value propositions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Address overpowered elements: Investigate the complaints about new additions or updates making certain cards too powerful, creating an unbalanced meta that discourages non-paying players from enjoying the game competitively. Balance these features to ensure fair play for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Improve connectivity stability: Prioritize addressing issues related to poor connection and disconnections during games, as this significantly impacts player experience and satisfaction. Ensure that technical support is readily available in case of such problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Revamp the user interface (UI): Simplify navigation within the game's UI by reducing tab switching and making essential elements more prominent to streamline gameplay experience and assist players in finding required items quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Revisit leveling mechanics: Make sure that the level system encourages skill development rather than a pay-to-level strategy, allowing every player to enjoy the progression process without feeling pressured to spend money.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Engage with loyal customers and address their concerns: Continue engaging with your core community of players by gathering feedback on proposed changes and implementing improvements that resonate well with them. This will foster a sense of ownership among existing fans, improving overall satisfaction for both long-time players and new ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these recurring issues and focusing on creating an enjoyable and fair experience for all players, Clash Royale can regain its former reputation as a competitive and fun game that encourages skill development over monetary investment.\n"
