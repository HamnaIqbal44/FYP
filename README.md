# FYP Description
## Automated User Feedback Analysis Tool

### 📖 Project Overview

Software maintenance is the most important and time-consuming phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Developers often spend significant effort analyzing user feedback to identify issues and required improvements. This project proposes an automated feedback analysis tool that collects user reviews from the Google Play Store for various social media applications, performs sentiment analysis, categorizes reviews into different quality attributes, and then provides possible suggestions for improvement using the Phi-3 LLM model by Ollama.
By automating the process of interpreting feedback, this tool helps developers maintain social media applications more effectively, saving time and cost while ensuring that user concerns and expectations are addressed.

### 🚀 Features

1. Scrapes user reviews from Google Play Store.
2. Performs sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral).
3. Categorizes feedback into quality attributes (e.g., performance, usability, security, reliability).
4. Uses LLM Phi-3 (Ollama) to generate actionable improvement suggestions.
5. Provides structured insights for developers to improve software maintenance.
