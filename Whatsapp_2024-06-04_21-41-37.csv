Mosa Bhai,"May 22, 2024","""WhatsApp is a good app, but it's starting to feel a bit outdated. The constant updates often bring bugs and glitches, which can be frustrating. I wish there were more innovative features and a more modern design. The app's functionality is still solid, but it needs some fresh ideas to stay ahead of the competition."" Suggestions - Revamp the app's design and user interface - Introduce more innovative features, like augmented reality effects or advanced AI-powered chatbots."
Najeeb Ahmadzai,"May 31, 2024","I don't know if anybody else have the same issue as me or not, but when i try to add a video to my status the quality im other apps or my gallery is very good like full HD but when i upload it to my status the quality gets bad like very bad. It looks grainy in other words just bad. Hope the authorities do some work there or just add an option like sending to someone it shows in which quality you want to share Standard or HD quality, that well help."

The app is user-friendly, and I appreciate the end-to-end encryption for secure conversations. The group chat feature is also very useful for staying connected with friends and family.

Karamat Jalal,"May 15, 2024","This application is great for chatting services, but I encountered a couple of issues. First, when I tried to share my arrival video to my destination city, it was quickly uploaded to my status by mistake. I think there should be a password requirement to prevent children from accidentally posting statuses. Secondly, I found a bug where I don't receive calls on time, even when I am connected to the internet. Calls often appear as missed calls instead."
Habib Akram,"May 17, 2024","May 13, 2024 I've been using this app for couple of years. Good to see new features day by day. But now we can unlock our whatsapp using our pattern too. It should not be like that. I want it to unlock it by using fingerprint only like it was before. Add this feature so that we can unlock it by using our fingerprint only but not by pattern or any other means. Or there should be a choice to choose between both ""fingerprint and other means"" and ""fingerprint only""."
Aqib Technical,"May 28, 2024",I am using WhatsApp 3 years. First off all all things are running smoothly.But the language of my WhatsApp have been changed almost 30 days ago.i just understand English language. Moreover it's does not provide modern communication system. It needs to have full heavy graphics with modern communication. But it seems boring while chatting due to its features . It needs to improve its features.
Officials Mohsin,"March 30, 2024","I think you're asking me to describe the user interface of WhatsApp, specifically the older user-friendly version and the newer version which may not be as user-friendly. In the older version of WhatsApp, the user interface typically featured a clean and simple design with a navigation bar at the top of the screen. The navigation bar included icons for Chats, Status, Calls, and Contacts. The chat interface had a list of conversations with profile pictures, names, and last message previews."
Ali Azmat,"March 23, 2024","As a long-time user of WhatsApp, I've seen numerous updates over the years, but the recent one introducing navigation buttons is truly disappointing. It seems like a step backward in terms of creativity and easy access. Navigating through the app has become cumbersome, and the lack of intuitive design is noticeable. I hope the developers reconsider this change and prioritize user experience in future updates."
Faisal Akram,"April 10, 2024","Nonstop changes in the user interface are incredibly frustrating. Every time I open the app, it feels like I'm navigating through a maze of new layouts with same features. Instead of enhancing user experience, these changes only serve to confuse and irritate. It's disappointing that stability and familiarity seem to be sacrificed for the sake of unnecessary updates. Considering the constant disruptions, I can't justify giving more than one star review."
Imran Ali,"April 25, 2024","It is amazing app and has huge amount of users across the globe. Anyhow, they are keep changing the layout for no reasons and specific improvements, rather making it a bit slow and irrsponsive on loads. The meta AI feature seems useless to me here. Also, it significantly degrade pictures quality upon sharing, I am not sure if the HD uploading will work."
Awais Sandrana,"March 21, 2024","The new split view on my tablet is horrible. If some people want or like it there needs to be the option to choose the previous full screen view. I use WhatsApp daily and was very happy with it. Now it looks cluttered and confusing. I do not want to see all my contacts and messages when am reading or sending a message to one of my contacts.The app is overall amazing for communication, and it's very easy to use as well. I don't really have any issue with it, but there is this new update in tablet"
Eman Hussain,"May 7, 2024","The app is good. But could you possibly include some privacy? Conceal it if you're offering us the choice to archive or lock chats. It's obvious from the top that I'm hiding conversations. I'll offer you an idea if you can't make it much more hidden. Simply select the locked app chat option last, underneath the most recent chat, so that no one can see it plainly. Likewise, the status section is used.If you're going to be making any modifications to your programme, create a separate section."
Muhammad Ghayas,"May 6, 2024","WhatsApp should focus on making the app more efficient instead of adding more features which makes the app even more complex to use especially for old aged people. Whatsapp is a communication app and the features like Channels, communities, stickers, avatars etc are just a wastage of time. There must be an option to switch modes like it is in binance app where you select the simple version or the complex version."
Ijaz khadim Khadim,"April 29, 2024","It was an amazing app, but the recent update has made it worse, no longer user-friendly, poor colour combination for interface, one of the most important and pathetic updated feature is that it deletes the saved media from gallery, now users have to save media one by one from each chat which itself is a too time consuming.... All I can say is at least restore the auto save option. Why are you destroying the ease for users?"
Hash,"May 2, 2024","It was a great app but after the update, it became the worst app ever. I always get banned without doing anything and after then I cannot login 'cause it doesn't send any SMS for the verification. The last issues is about the the color, the color combination before the update was far and wide better than the recent. Looking forward for your cooperation in fixing these issues."
Ali Raza,"April 14, 2024","Often updates has made the app user experience frustrating. The UI was simple, but in recent updates, its becoming very bloated hence confusing the daily users. As u know, the audience of whatsapp belongs to both educated and uneducated people. Also, the major issue I faced and others have faced too, is the Image quality issue. Whenever, I upload an image, its quality is drastically reduced. So kindly please look into this issue on priority.Thanks."
Inshal Khan,"March 24, 2024","The app overall has not so good performance but yes it was okay until the status issue popped up, like first I thought the issue was with the video but then I realized that Whatsapp has glitches. When I upload the status the video automatically become blur and same is the case with photos. I want you to give some attention to this issue. Thanks!"
Ahmed Ali Riaz,"April 27, 2024","It was an amazing app, but the recent updates have made it worse, no longer user-friendly, poor colour combination for interface, one most important and pathetic updated feature is that it has deleted the saved media from gallery, now users have to save media one by one from individuals chats which is it self a too time consuming.... All I can say is at least restore the auto save option. Why are you destroying the ease for users?"
Marium Zara,"March 27, 2024","I have been using WhatsApp for almost a decade now. But the recent updates have made WhatsApp loose its charm and grace. Despite there being various aspects that can be improved and updated, I don't know why the developers keep changing the entire interface, which is the basic charm of WhatsApp. Just like there's a separate section for communities, there should be a separate section for group chats that aren't part of communicaties as well. Bring back the old interface, its more practical."
Explore Nature,"April 20, 2024","WhatsApp keeps making constant changes to its user interface, which can be frustrating. Each update introduces a new layout with the same features, but instead of enhancing user experience, these changes often lead to confusion. We hope for an update that includes the ability to upload high-quality videos for statuses or updates. I can't justify giving more than a one-star review."
Axel Kirch,"May 30, 2024","Not bad, especially thanks to the end-to-end encryption it provides. For a few weeks, however, I've had a display error that makes it impossible to comfortably read the messages without copying and pasting the contents into a text editor: There is almost no contrast between the message text and the background, something that spoiled the experience in my LINE messenger as well for about two years now. Hopefully unlike LINE messenger, you guys will fix it soon. Cheers!"
SAJJAD HOSSAN,"May 18, 2024","An incredible ""WhatsApp is a necessary communication application. With its smooth interface, end-to-end encryption, and wealth of features, it is perfect for keeping in touch. No matter if it is texting or video calling a person, WhatsApp has got you covered for both reliability and convenience. But then again, sometimes there may be some problems with call quality or notifications. In general, though, when it comes to instant messaging services this one is king."""
ionut mihai Paduraru,"May 22, 2024","It is extremely disappointing since Facebook got involved! Please remove all the features and make it back as it was. Nothing works fine when you try to add too much. It is annoying. We do not want to see updates, communities, and other things. All that is needed is a chat, end to end encrypted! Plus that it crashes so many times on calls, and the quality is poor. It became the worst app for chat. People will migrate to other platforms like Signal if you don't have common sense to change it."
Daniel,"June 1, 2024","It was an excellent app for private messaging, and now it's becoming a multifunction app. It is better to have an app built for one purpose rather than packing multiple functions into one app. I don't want ""AI"" to be at the top of my chat list, nor do I want to see it at all! Personally, I also don't need the communities tab or the updates tab. Also the photo edit ""draw over photo"" feature was much better before the update."
Rhonda Alicia Neptune - Mc Knight,"May 24, 2024","A place where people meet and exchange ideas, pictures, sayings, feelings, cultures, events and the list goes on. Thanks for the opportunity that is inexpensive and easy. Even the elderly use WhatsApp with ease. There is no distance in communication because people from different geographic locations are able to meet on this platform individually or in a group. You can have meetings on the go. Thank you WhatsApp 😊 💓 ☺️ 💗 💛 💖 😊"
Enyi Olivia,"May 24, 2024","This is a great app. The only problem it has is the picture and video quality, it reduces both video and picture qualities to a point where a very clear picture becomes awfully blur. It is even worse these days especially when you make a video or picture and post on your status, everything looks absolutely awful. I really hope this would be fixed soon."
Courtney Cooper,"May 10, 2024","I Loved the additional features of the GB WhatsApp. Being able to choose themes & such, maybe you can upgrade this version with some of those features? Also, I just picked up on a bug with the current upgrade, whenever I go to view my own status the 'total viewers' at the bottom does not show. So I have to exit the status to go back in, in order for me to check that information. Not sure whats up with that but hopefully it's fixable as it gets annoying."

Saad,"May 29, 2024","I've been using WhatsApp for a while now, and it has always been a fantastic app for staying connected with friends and family. Recently, I was experiencing some lagging issues with the Meta AI integration, but since the latest update, everything has been running smoothly. The lag is completely gone, and the app's performance is outstanding. Highly recommended!💯"
Dominique Kettemer,"June 2, 2024","I have to use this app, cause everyone has it, but it's quality does not reach it's competitors. They have at least one major bug each year, where people can hack your phone with. Adding to this their new features rollout lags five years behind Telegram and mostly they just copy their features, not even doing anything truly inventive. The image compression is not good, which results basically in images no one can use anymore."
Ajay M,"May 25, 2024","WHATSAPP PLEASE TWO MORE FEATURES: 1. Make a feature so that you cannot only mute yourself, BUT ALSO the other person. And 2: A feature that you can also lower the volume of the call when in a videocall. (Only possible when in normal audio call. Why?) I think many people would love to see those new features, but never has been implemented. And sometimes the (video)call crashes for literally no reason. And sometimes when you want to record a voice message there's no sound at all. FIX IT!"
Bright Kegbe,"May 28, 2024","This has been a great app, best messaging app by a distance. The recent changes are great. But it can be improved upon. With people having so many groups these days, *groups chats need to be separated from individuals*. There should be option to change the default display menu colours and outlook. In short more customization option should be integrated."
Dumitru Radoi,"May 28, 2024","It is a very good app, but with limited config capabilities. It needs a config panel that would allow users to store media files (large, static files) in a different location (like SD card, to use less space on the phone storage) while keeping chats / DB files (small, dynamic files) on the phone (as most of the SD cards will eventually fail due to frequent changes on these files)"
Ibrahim “Elbadri” Idris,"May 16, 2024","Excellent app, I use it on daily bases. Just two requests,:- 1- Giving the group administrators the rights to ""ENABLE/DISABLE SENDING MESSAGES"" from the one's who couldn't understand the group policy, but he/she can read only, while the others can send messages normaly. 2- In the latest update I face the problem of hearing the audio files which playing only for 2 seconds and stop and the screen becomes black and return. Thanks very much for your greatest app in social media."
Chitransh Gayakwad,"May 13, 2024","I've been experiencing a lot of notification issues since the new update. There is only a notification saying, ""you may have new messages"" and then when we open the app, all the messages are received then with their original time stamps when they were actually sent. Also, sending messages is also taking way too much time and the sender only sees a single tick even when you are online in the app. This is causing too many problems and defeating the purpose of the platform and it's practicality."

Godwin Caesar,"May 24, 2024",The new features are easy to operate. Messages are fast and with quick responses. I also like the AI they've introduced it makes learning and searching for information much easier. This especially helpful for students who may want to explore online discussion. Overall I am excited and fill with so much joy when using the app. It is as though you have a friend right beside you at any point in time.
Alejandro Chagoyán,"May 10, 2024",Need hands-free and Bluetooth voice record for voice notes. new update sucks. I need to swipe right/left to move from chats to status and so on. this update is going backwards instead of innovating. new edit functionality is good. but can be better. edit menu is all over the top. why not the swipe left is the edit function or in a long clic near the keyboard. I'm not editing any message due to distance from my fingers.
R,"May 20, 2024","The messaging works fine and has a nice feature set. However its only back-up solution involves mandatory usage of Google Drive. It doesn't let you use any other cloud service or even an offline copy (so you can save it yourself). This is completely unacceptable and anti-competitive, since for bigger backups the only option is to pay Google for cloud space."
Abiyaal Philip,"June 1, 2024","Nice app. I would suggest that this app should have 'Do Not Disturb' features where users can setup their own specific time to not receive any messages from anyone eventhough the phone is connected to mobile data/wifi. The messages may start to receive after the user resume back to ""General"" mode. This will be good for the mental health."
Simon Habte,"May 17, 2024","sometimes there are issues when u call especially with a lower connection, but, even though Whatsapp is my best preference for any kind of contact with people. it's easy fast and reliable application. I really like it. And above all, the things that you update and send to every user, I love that. that means keeping everyone inform and delightful."
Kwesi Akladey,"May 24, 2024","Statuses made by people when I'm offline doesn't show, as if no body made a status. When I send messages to people they don't see it. They can come into the chat but won't tick double or blue. What's up with that? All this started after the update. I had to delete it and download it again hoping it will stop but it didn't. I don't know the use of updating an up it it keep bringing new problems"
Owen Ramírez,"June 1, 2024","After I changed my phone (Galaxy S21+) to a (S24 Ultra), I've lost all my WhatsApp data. I've tried to use the feature to copy all my chats from one phone to another, but it didn't work. Then I've tried to download the WhatsApp backup, and it didn't work either, it tells me that is ""unable to recover backup"". I've lost a lot of data, including some photos and videos that meant a lot to me. This thing happened to other family members too. I'm very disappointed with this app."

John Purssey,"May 31, 2024","WhatsApp works well as a messaging and voice/video calling system for groups. Note that when ia person is added to a group they can see only messages sent after they joined. An undesirable consequence for me is that when my phone died and reinstall to a new phone from backup did not work, after installing on the new phone and logging in with my user ID and password, although all the groups were there, I could not access any of the old posts that had been available on the old phone."
A Google user,"May 31, 2024","Why do you shut down the app without notifying me, simply because I have automatic updates shut off. Every several days, I am bombarded with updates to apps that came loaded on the phone that I don't even use. So I turned off automatic downloads in order to control the flood of space eating data. I missed a very important message, at a crucial moment because what's app was shut down. At least sent a notification with an alarm attached so I will be aware that you have caused the app to shut down."
Don't Shoot The Messanger,"May 12, 2024","Never had a problem with this app. It's quick, easy to use, and very convenient. I much prefer it to all the other massaging apps on the market. Especially those that are attached to ultra huge platforms and monopolisers. I'd recommend this not just for its functionality but also because it respects my privacy. It leaves me alone. It doesn't hassle me or ask me for things (only an occasional update)."
Akhil A K,"May 21, 2024","WhatsApp has become a lot better these days. They've updated the app to a new look and skin and added features that were missing for a long time.. - the edit message option and text to any number rather than only to a saved contact. And msg-to-oneself feature. Feature Suggestion : it would be useful if it was possible to select a part of sent/received messages with copy option. Currently, u can only copy an entire message. There is No way to select a portion of a sent/received msg."
