Hadyan Aufar,"May 31, 2024","Update on bugs (310524): Seems like the bugs that cause the game to be unplayable after opening any chests have been fixed. However, I found some bugs while inflated Bubbles is sucked into launcher flowers, which cause it to be spinning mid-air, uninflated, before popping. Also, I can't quit the game from the main menu and tapping on back button. I have to select any menu and back again several times before the quit the game prompt shows up."
Xavier Wagner,"May 30, 2024",I would like to be able to update the game on my LG Stylo 4 when the updates are released so I won't have to worry about bugs and crashes hindering my gameplay experience. I would also like to be able to open the support page without the app crashing and making sending feedback and reporting bugs harder than it needs to be. I would also appreciate it if the gameplay didn't rely on luck all the time. Other instances of crashes are whenever I play the Level Map and go to the app's home page.
Jens P.,"May 22, 2024","Enough with the zillions of pop-up windows! For some obscure reason, developers (in contrast to most players) seem not to have realized that the recent increase of pop-ups in the main menu dramatically instabilizes the game. It's not about ""improving performance"" with fancy updates. It's about simply getting rid of those pop-ups! Can you do that or do you want to lose more long-time players?"
Chris Kartman,"May 24, 2024",The new energy points system is bull... Used to play this all the time. Now you have 60 energy points to start and reach level takes 10 points to play. Please change it back to the way it was without the energy points garbage. Going to add on to this review. The game freezes on the daily challenge after you get done with the first level and then if you try to hit next it will not take you 2.
Samiel GuentherScott,"May 26, 2024","Constant issues. Game freezing up for no reason, pulling up menus that won't let me click off of them, telling me to check my internet connection even if it's perfectly fine. Also have issues with pigs being off screen but not dying, so I can't pass levels and can do nothing about it, as well as almost passing a level but then it automatically ending on its own before all pigs can die. It's getting very annoying. Please fix these issues."
Victorio Macasaet,"June 1, 2024","Always stalling, rewards not given. Help system is useless. Game appears rigged. Glaring mismatches in arena, makes it impossible to win. Random sessions do not appear random, or players are just extremely unlucky. Help system is useless. Only offers excuses , not solutions. The app stalls easily also. They asked me to contact support. I have done so a hundred times. They only offer excuses . And that's after a long time (delayed reply)."
Aniket Kumar,"May 27, 2024","It is a good game, but their are too many glitches! When I press forward button to go into the new room, it does not go to the New room and keeps on forwarding, the pause button does not works. I have to restart the game and have to start the level Again! Due to this the progress I made in games went down. Sometimes, when I opens a chest and choose a card, the touchscreen does not works. I hope you will fix this problem as early as possible.."
NublyPix,"May 26, 2024","Okay. I'm re-reviewing this app and it went from 3 stars to 2. The game was fun to play back in the day, but now there are audio issues here and there. For instance, whenever I don't want to hear any sound coming from the game, it still has the faint sound of the flock and the grunts of the pigs. Not to mention the echo included. I'm glad you fixed the soft-lock issue, but this is ridiculous! Please fix it ASAP."
Martin S,"May 24, 2024","Disappointed! I have been playing this game on and off on different devices and Always had different version of them installed on my phone. But now, game is full of ads, too much stuff forced into the game play, and it became so cluttered that I closed it every single time after just 1 min or two of playing. You guys losing players like this.. falling from ""one of the top games on the phone"" to ""hardly recommend by anyone"""
Jill Sellers,"May 24, 2024","The new update seems to have disabled the ability to turn off the noises the birds make. I can't listen to the game and another show at the same time. The popups that freeze the game also really suck. It would be great if you could fix that. Basically every time I open the app, I have to close all apps then restart the game again."
Davvey L,"May 20, 2024","The game itself is quite enjoyable - playing with the physics in the game is great, the birds are all well defined and different enough to be considered unique. This falls down for me is the adds. Not the adds to gain a new life for the various mini games they are fine and is smart. On the map with all the levels and zones after beating some of the levels and then having an add pop up that halts you playing defeats the purpose of the app. Personally i close it, not wanting to play it anymore."
Sj Milburn,"May 18, 2024",Unexpectedly Loved this game but- sometimes there are so many layers of mini games & other stuff that I can't continue...3 layers interfere...I'm trying like hell to get something to work...I'm tapping my fingers off. When everything's in sync it's amazing! What is happening?? Still glitches HELPno one cares...be prepared to spend $$ if you don't want to be stuck on a level for weeks at a time. The mini games are fun though
L Sherwood,"May 17, 2024","Breaks my heart to give this game 1 star. I have played for years on several devices. Completely addicted. But now, I think I am being forced into the pay to play level. Makes no sense to spend hours/days on one level. The challenge becomes frustration. I was informed all levels can be won w/o boosters, extra plays, coins, but how many attempts does it take? 100's? Thousands? Feels like it."
Withered0326 (Withered0326),"April 27, 2024","Recently playing the game just soft locks itself when trying to progress to the next stage. This happens during levels, and in ranked as well. I don't know what causes it but I can't prevent it. I can't even pause the game to exit as it still continues playing sounds. So I'm forced to close the game, losing the stage or battle regardless if I was winning. Which really sucks. Wastes energy. Can't even do the daily challenge level 2. It won't even load. And when I relog, I'm back at level 1!"
Carrie M,"April 25, 2024","Like so many of the current reviews I used to love playing this game but it has become such a Money Grab and so greedy! Whenever a new challenge is introduced, there are tons of glitches you end up losing money from the game. You end up losing prizes from the game. You can never find the website to send issues and emails to get help or report a problem. The prizes are not proportional to the money you spend. And, the ads!! All of the bleeping time!! They have even started doing two ads at once"
Damien Bell,"May 2, 2024","Classic game. Came back to it to play for nostalgic reasons. I love how the game is today BUT if you're gonna put pop up windows to advertise new features in the game MAKE SURE YOU PUT A CLOSE BUTTON ON THEM!!! You can play the game but if you get hit with one of these pop up windows you'll have to close the game, and reload it every time! The ads make the game almost unplayable!"
Jordan Tichenor,"April 25, 2024","I like the game, although it seems like the campaign levels are pretty bland compared to the other levels/challenges available in the game. Lately the game has been freezing essentially where you will hit the button to speed up the game and then it will continue to be in that state where the grey lines are spinning and spinning and spinning. Please fix this annoying issue. Not only is it taking longer to progress through the levels, but I am losing streaks in more than one area of the game."
G Robinson,"April 23, 2024","The game came back, now every other arena game I play crashes, no matter if I am winning or losing. So thinking it was just the arena, it wasnt...the regular game crashes every two games. I believe I will be giving this up soon, constantly sending 'feedback' reports is getting on my nerves. I do not like the tickets instead of having gems in the arena. 2024. Arena crashes every two games. Lose progress in the meantime. After 7 years you wouldn't thing this would still be a issue, only worse. -5"
Anubhav Mishra,"April 28, 2024","The game is good, but way too buggy. It freezes every other day while playing. Now, when pressing the fast forward button, it froze a few times today. It's too loaded with fancy features and screen changes that are not needed. I get at least 4 pop-ups every time I start the game about things I already know. It could be so much simpler. Edit: Dropping a star as one just can't play the game these days at all without it freezing every 5 minutes."
Just Call Me Ben,"April 25, 2024",Since the patch there's been a lot of not playing the game happening.. I keep getting stuck at the loading screen and need to restart the game in order to get back only to have the same thing happen. I'm losing out on the times activities and I'm wasting the cards that are being used to help me on the harder levels... Each time I start a new game thinking it's going to work I end up not even being able to get to them and it counts it as being used. Not to mention the same goes for the lives
Daniel Maclellan,"April 26, 2024","I've thoroughly enjoyed playing, but it jad a handful of bugs where levels would freeze, and you'd have to restart the game and lose progress and any items used. Since the most recent update, it's damn near unplayable. I have lost so many resources to freezing. It's everywhere, Pig King panic, the arena (I lost two streaks because match 3 froze 2 times last night alone) I'd roll this back it's a nightmare and I'll come back Edit: changed to 3 for fast response. Will adjust once you update game"
SHUBHANJALI GUPTA,"May 1, 2024","It is a good game, but their are too many glitches! When I press forward button to go into the new room, it does not go to the New room and keeps on forwarding,the pause button does not works.

I hope you will fix this problem as early as possible.."
James Smith,"April 24, 2024","I can play on average about 2 or 3 rounds or watch an ad, then it freezes and I have to restart it. Honestly it's so often it takes the fun out of it. In fact it's rather frustrating. Numerous times it freezes after passing a level or beating someone in the arena, then it freezes and the won match translates to a lost match. It's aittle bit ridiculous In fact, update about 20 minutes later: I've rebooted 5 times, literally. All 5 times were matches I'd won, then crashes points lost. Uninstalled"
Bob Rozalsky,"April 30, 2024","This game has become infuriating where each bug fixing update just breaks or doesn't even work. There are multiple updates where they address the issue of freezing where it fixes temporarily, but then it will go back to freezing. For the past year, this game used to be so fun, but it has degraded ever since the push for online with no offline mode, which would be very useful. Most of the new features and renfinements are good and useful, but it's sadly being overshadowed by bugs."
Pamela,"May 2, 2024","I like this game however, it has problems. Mainly freezing up multiple times while playing. Ads also freeze up. Don't upgrade your hatching. I didn't realize I would have to feed it 20 apples everyday and apples are very hard to come by. Newest update is terrible. I have to turn the sound down because the loud la la la song is terrible. Game is still slow and gets stuck on commercials."
Matt Hays,"May 21, 2024","*** I'm uninstalling this before it causes me to break my phone! I've never played a game with so much potential that pisses me off as much as this one This app is great... EXCEPT: - Too much waiting on levels to come up - WAY too much stuff on screen to play on a phone... Can't see what the heck you're doing!! This was written for a bigger screen. - Energy runs out too fast, given the other two points."
Kevin Espin,"May 19, 2024","Last couple months, this game has been trashed by the developer. You used to have lives, losing one if you didn't complete a level. Now, every play uses credits. But you can pay or watch videos (I didn't pay attention to which) if you want to play more. Black Pearls were a daily bonus, now you have to watch a video to get them. A Spinning Wheel for rewards is new, but you have to watch a video to spin. What feels like 127 splash screens constantly freeze the app. Not enough room to list it all."
Angela deJong,"May 24, 2024","There are a lot of ads and pop ups in the game. Some of the ads start at the end of a level or when navigating back to the main screen which is disruptive to the experience. It also has a lot of glitches like random freezing and the loss of sound control. I don't know why the in game audio controls no longer work, but it's really annoying to no longer be able to turn off the in game sounds."
JOMAR JM {flyingtacos_},"May 23, 2024","Until then, for how biased it may sound? Angry birds 2 of all things is really really charming, fun and outright a blast to play out and about. BUT ROVIO, WHY DO YOU MAKE IT ONLINE ONLY? HAVE IT BE OFFLINE COMPATIBLE FOR THE MAIN HUB WORLD! If you only change that, and let us change birds? (Because after you get more than three and you go in a level? You can't choose the others, you are FORCED to use any of the birds and pray you get it. But even then! They would be useless by now-"
Joshua Kramer,"April 24, 2024","I like this game and can usually get over how annoying the constant events and popups and offers are because it's still fun to play. Lately it freezes SO much though, that it's really hard to enjoy. Especially when it gets stuck in the middle of an arena match and i not only lose but lose my streak because i have to restart the app."
Katie Bee,"May 21, 2024","It's a very buggy game. Each update which is meant to be events brings a new set of bugs, from crashes to freezes and the ""support"" is either telling you to reinstall the game or says they know about the bugs and to wait. It's been especially bad over the last 9 months or so and I cannot recommend this game because of how bad the bugs now are."
Allan Beasley,"May 23, 2024","Fun but INFESTED with ads. Now the ads have gotten to 60 seconds long and you could spend 15 minutes watching ads before you start actually playing. I get so burned out on everything depending on watching an ad that I don't really want to play any more after sitting through minute after minute of ads to pick up the bonuses when I log in. Probably just gonna uninstall again. The gameplay is fun, but the ads make it hard to enjoy."
Holly Allen,"April 27, 2024","This game used to be fun to play but now it freezes up midway through most everything you try to do. Battles, tournaments, daily challenge all of it. There's so many in game pop ups that freeze the game and force you to close an reopen. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to report these issues like in the past, so I guess it has yo be addressed here"
Jeramy Holmes,"May 26, 2024","Volume....new update compromised a true no volume option. Even un-installed thinking it may have been me; was willing to sacrifice levels earned, but nope. After selecting no sound in setting, there are still noises being made. How can I play at work or various settings with birds and pigs grunting loudly every 5 to 10 seconds?? I can't....I can't smh"
BRET Mayer,"May 2, 2024","Been playing for several years, like others I had to uninstall and reinstall since the last ""upgrade"" screwed things up. Now I can't get my old account back, I lost all my jems, all my pearls, my flock that we just came off a 17 game winning streak gone. This happened years ago and I had to start all over again, not going to do it again!!!! If this can't be resolved simply without jumping through hoops, they lost another long time player!!!"
Karisa Murphy,"May 2, 2024","I used to play this game every day, and I spent a lot of money in the game. Now the game freezes, kicks me out of battles. I dontbget my prizes I paid money for, I don't get the prizes I watched videos for because it freezes. One screen gets frozen over the other and I have to close the app. When I reached out nothing was done, no one assisted me, but I got a notice that they were happy they resolved the issue, when NOTHING was resolved. There are just a ton of glitches."
Brian Norris,"April 27, 2024",Way too many bugs. Freezes constantly so you lose progress on challenges. Don't waste time or money. The fast forward freezes the game every time. The Arena freezes every time it's attempted and have lost a bunch of rating due to this. Need to fire some programmers cuz game gas gotten significantly worse in last few months. Now can no longer use the fast forward button. Freezes every time. Absolutely garbage I will now be uninstall ingredients the app.
Captain Ogre,"May 8, 2024","What are you guys doing to this game? The last few patches to ""fix"" the problems is not fixing things. Freezes at the end of Arena and Eagle, to where you have to hard-close the app. When you log back in, all progress is lost! There is way too much pay-to-win, and don't get me started on Tower of Cost-A-Fortune crashes and costs. And all the ADS! ADS! MORE ADS! This game must hold the record for the amount of ADS that you have to watch, just to get to the actual game itself! I'm out!"
Joseph Iudice,"May 28, 2024","Buggy. Can't complete challenges because the next level won't begin. Copies the start screen over screen for next level of challenge. So cannot play second level of challenge and uses up life, then you have to start over at the beginning with level 1 again. Similar reviews seem to have the same issue. Garbage game. Yesterday the challenges worked as intended, today they are back to failing to advance. Maybe patch the bug and push an update?"
Eyes DriedOpen,"May 18, 2024","Edit: recent update finally fixed the game, mostly. Still crashes occasionally, mid-game, which is irritating but not a deal breaker. Still a good game that rewards you for watching ads rather than forcing them. Normally a great game. Now game constantly freezes. Nyo rewards from watching ads, most game modes freeze halfway through."
Steve,"May 23, 2024","Its definitly a newer angrybirds... visually it got very much better. But... its only 3 stars because of the strong pay-to-win incensitives. There are too many payable items and the game now tries to keep you playing daily in order to get bonus score as well... I still play this stuff on the toilet, so ain't nobody got time for that! Short version: Here's angrybirds, the modern version, with way to many microtransactions!"
Ranieri Saldanha,"May 31, 2024","It's a really fun game and it used to be almost perfect, but the constant ads ABSOLUTELY RUINED the game as a whole. The new energy system limiting my playtime to barely nothing is also an incredibly stupid decision. What a masterclass on how to ruin an experience that used to be so enjoyable. Shame."
Natalie W,"May 8, 2024","UI is very busy. Lots of ads popping up and icons blinking to promote ads which all cause you not to know how to progress in the ""game"". The energy system is my least favorite mechanic. You can only play 6 times before you can't play anymore (terrible for the 45-90min work commutes). This ""game"" really doesn't promote fun, but promotes cash for progress."
Sherry Bernklau,"May 25, 2024","Love the game, but absolutely HATE the sounds. For some reason, the setting for turning off the sound is not working. It shows that the sound is off, but it is not off. I have tried everything I can think of to get rid of the sounds , but nothing has been successful. The sound is so obnoxious to me that I am going to have to stop playing the game if I can't get it turned off. What is the fix for that?"
Ravi,"April 30, 2024","Every other arena match freezes. My arena points are about 200 less than last week, without having lost a single match. Edit : ok, this is getting frustrating. The freezes have increased. Rebooting phone hasn't helped. Just going to have to stop playing till an update comes out. Edit (4/29/24) : Freezing issue seems to have been resolved in the latest update. Was able to do the full arena streak without freezing up."
Blueblackeragon 17,"April 28, 2024","TOO MANY BUGS AND FREEZING!!! I restarted the gave 6 times because the same level would freeze after passing it and lost lives after having to restart it same with any other side game such as the arena I lost my streak because of the game freezing up, or when I try to fast forward, it would stay on the same challenge even after all the pigs and birds have cleared out and there is no more activity Its just starting to become a huge headache and has been frustrating to keep playing"
Matthew Perry,"April 25, 2024","If you're looking for the game that had you addicted in the late 2000s, you've come to the wrong place. Android users should search for the early games in Google search, NOT the Play Store. IOS users will not be able to play the classics anymore. Sucks to suck. Extreme amount of pop-ups. Extreme amount of video ads. 3 stars is now just a participation trophy that you get for ANY completion. Levels change everytime you restart. Levels get reused later down the line. Offline play is no more."
Susan Couldwell,"May 3, 2024","Edit.. this game goes from bad to worse! It now won't play the ads.. every time I click to play an add for rewards it takes me straight back to the login screen!! Since the last update I can't complete the arena or clan battle or daily challenge, after 2 or 3 minutes play the game freezes. 🤬 This game just keeps getting worse.. the freezes are happening more and more often now !!"
Austin Strong,"April 29, 2024","It's a fun game, but it's partially unplayable because it locks up in missions and you therefore lose ""playtime points"" because you ""lost"" the level - I've been stuck on 67 for several days. It's also filled with many incredible ways to entice players to empty their wallets just so they can simply continue playing."
ryan forney,"April 24, 2024","The game is fun, however the last few months the amount of times the game lags, freezes from all the pop screens, freezes during transition from match to match causing me to lose or gems or matches, and the glitches have become unbearable. I've been playing since day one and have every version of AB but this me considering deleting them altogether."
