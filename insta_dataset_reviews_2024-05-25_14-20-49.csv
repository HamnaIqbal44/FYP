"The app is good for connecting with friends, family and even potential business partners. However as of recently I've experienced some problems with the messages portion of the app (ex: themes aren't showing up on my end but are present on other person's end). Idk if it has to do with a bug but it happened all of sudden out of nowhere on both of my pages (one private the other public). But besides the occasional bugs and sometimes the app/website being down randomly, I say it's a decent app.",7/11/2023 23:57
"Used to be my favorite social media app, but ""improvements"" have made it harder and harder to use and I find myself using less and less. The most recent terrible ""feature"" added makes the photo carousels autoswipe after 3 seconds. There is no way to turn this off and it is driving me crazy. You are not TikTok - stop trying to be. Also, dark mode breaks down all the time and I find myself in an environment where the background is white with white text, making it impossible to read anything.",7/22/2023 21:37
"Instagram is the best of all the social media. IG is not just a posting platform, it facilitates the processs of getting one's message out to the world. The design functionality of the interface is intuitive and user friendly. It guides me to the best possible options without limiting or directing what I do with my content. No other platform is as responsive or even remotely aware of the unique needs I have. IG knows how to innovate and improve the presentation of complex content.",7/25/2023 3:24
"I love this app.. but as of late, I have been having problems with the screen and background turning white, longer than normal loading, and now it just keeps crashing! If I get a notification I can click and see but the moment I go to home page, it crashes. I uninstalled it, cleared the cache, restarted the phone and nothing works! Please fix the bug in this app.",7/9/2023 4:49
Used to be a great app but there are so many more bugs and issues than ever before. Plus they are ruining their user interface trying to keep up with other social media platforms. Making editing videos in the app extremely infuriating. It's like they try to add all these extra features but don't quite do it in the right way so it actually ends up limiting what you can do. It feels like I'm fighting instagram every time I just want to make a little 15 second reel.,7/17/2023 16:47
The app has been glitching alot. Videos will not play and instead just show a black screen. Audios will not play either. The message themes keep going back to default even once changed they do not stay. I've tried to delete and reinstall and it is still not working. I've done this multiple times as well as restart my phone and nothing has helped. Not working as it should be.,7/11/2023 5:04
"I like this app a lot, but the messaging part of the app is very frustrating. I sometimes won't get notifications when my friends respond to me. One time recently, I sent my friend a reel, and they responded, and then I went to see what they said, and the reel I sent were gone on my end, but they could still see them. Sometimes, I'll send messages, then leave the app, then go back, and it said I never sent the message. Wish the bugs would be fixed because I've dealt with this for a while.",7/18/2023 12:48
"Eventhough sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. The quality of videos uploaded to the site sucks as well as the recommended videos (Not Video Resolution). There is also a lack of configuration options for your recommendations, like wanting only verified accounts or just being able to manually change your interests, or just the ability to reset your suggestion feed. The way the site is set up can also be confusing. üëéto Instagram and Meta for the quality of this app, do better.",7/13/2023 14:01
"I'm not sure what the point of leaving a review will accomplish when the most recent reviews are all regarding the same issues and nothing has been done to address this. I have the same issues, videos, pages, shorts are not fully loading or refreshing, leaving me with black, gray or white screens. If I'm fortunate enough to see a video, short or photos it's the same stuff for days. I hope someone is working on a fix , but by the lack of any response from the developers, users don't matter",7/14/2023 2:26
"This app has so many frustrating aspects. The themes won't work, and when they do it works for 5 minutes then stops. The messages glitch out to where it looks like the messages have been deleted so you refresh the entire page. This happens whenever I open the app. Texting outside of the app hardly works. It doesn't send my messages through there, but when I go into the app it sent it twice. Then the notifications are the most glitchy. They stop until I restart my phone randomly for no reason.",7/13/2023 7:46
"The only complaint i have is about the video calling feature, its too small because it's split screen. Other than that, i love this app and use it daily. Edit 2/13/2022- this app has given me LOTS of issues. It's been twice where i open it and it says ""can't refresh feed."" I've tried uninstalling it and restarting the app but that didn't work. I've also had previous trouble logging in though that seems to be fixed now. I don't know what to do to get it to work. 7/20/23 it's long fixed lol",7/20/2023 14:29
"So a while ago, I noticed that when I talk to people my background keeps getting set back to default colors. I usually talk to my main people, and our background is different than default. But it won't go back, and when I change it the background would either go back to default or it would change but it would only last 1 minute. Please fix this, I've tried reinstalling but it didn't work. My friends said that theirs are normal, so there's something wrong with mine.",7/12/2023 5:02
"Love the app but everytime I open it, after about ten to twenty minutes of scrolling it just stops playing reels, and it is aggravating cause it'll let me scroll and reload stuff, but it will never play it, and it won't let me watch the videos in my saved/stories as well. I've been keeping it updated, I don't understand why it's doing this. Edit: and now it stopped working. Crashes every time I try to get into it.",7/9/2023 6:07
I was fine with all the updates until I watch video posts on the explore page and I HATE that after the clip is done it just moves on to the next post! Esp. if the post has more than one slide it will just move on before I can see the next slide! So Flippin annoying!! Update: now I get this weird black border around all of the videos if I don't tap into it üò°,7/26/2023 4:34
"Says I've had a msg for a year & none of the troubleshooting ideas work. Annoying, but tolerable. What's not is when I click on a Black content creator tagged in a caption & it won't load at all. Tried many times with several different accts & non-black accts opened just fine. I tried force-stopping, clearing data, uninstall/reinstall, restarting my phone, etc., just to be sure that what I'm seeing is actually what is happening. This seems deliberate & it needs to be corrected immediately.",7/11/2023 2:53
Was better before.. Now the comments are one long line (on mobile devices) whereas before the user could see all the text and proofread it before sending it. It's not always easy to get a point across in one sentence. Please make the UI more user friendly. Also I'm wondering what drives the pictures that come up in the search window? I get many that I have no interest in.,7/23/2023 20:06
"App switches to dark mode and unuseable. For the past few weeks, while using the app, it will switch to dark mode and made text in black background. So the posts are unreadable and the app is pretty much worthless and unuseable. It sounds like this is very common and needs to be addressed. There are too many other platforms out there now for Instagram to be letting this go for this long. And yes, I cleared all caches, reinstalled and the whole works. Several times. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",7/12/2023 13:18
"Even with light mode on, sometimes the app will turn the text to white on white so I can't read anything. Seems to happen everytime when I click a link in someone's bio and go back to the app. Chat themes also I can't see anymore. Would be good to turn off the autoplay feature since if I'm looking at a photo and there's a reel below, it'll automatically start playing the reel and once the reel is done it'll scroll to the next post even though I'm not done looking at the picture.",7/10/2023 17:21
"Pretty good app, and I use it frequently, but there's been some issues lately. One is the apps weird color scheme changes where the background and posts be a clash of black and white where I can't see texts, another being issues with chat themes. After I close out, it will automatically change back to pre-determined, and it sucks because I can't see the colors that give it a personality",7/10/2023 10:39
