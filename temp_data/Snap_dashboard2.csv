Yashu Mehla,"March 6, 2024",To edit a phone cam-clicked photo we have a filter & it's not ok Snapchat should have an option to edit or to put any filter on that. Also my main suggestion is to have a favourite filter column in editing snap corner as it only shows trending once & not the one I love . plz 🙏🏼 help me with it I always click photos with my camera or if bychance I have clicked without filter I find it very hard to put my favourite filter on it.,NEGATIVE,0.9962034821510316,4.0,FAULT TOLERANCE

Barsha Panda,"April 14, 2024","Absolutely horrible experience. It lags ever single month. Even after I've tried to maintain the streaks, it breaks because the app would just lag and if I delete and re-install it on my device.

Cassie MacDonald,"April 4, 2024","I've used this app for texting, calling, and taking pictures for as long as I can remember. I'm just experiencing problems at the moment, I can't open snaps. I'm clicking it and it won't work. When I enter the chat, it says message unavailable under the snap and the snap still won't open, it's really annoying me since I don't like having unopened messages.",NEGATIVE,0.9994930028915404,3.0,SECURITY
Shay Wilson,"April 17, 2024","There are very good protective measures and you can see when someone saves a message, picture, screenshots something, does anything to your story. it's amazing! The only thing is that it's quite easy to scroll and get addicted to people's post and news and etc. in my opinion.",POSITIVE,0.9986112117767334,,
amelia s,"March 16, 2024","Snapchat is a great app. But I've been having a problem, whether it won't let me open a snap and it will just be loading forever, or when I view people's stories it's just black and won't let me proceed. Overall the filters and everything is great.",POSITIVE,0.9971206784248352,,
Iyana Perry,"April 1, 2024","3/31/24 Snapchat is very slow and barely can stay on without crashing. You can't go through the snap stories nor text anyone without a message coming up and saying that it needs to close. It might be my phone but if not, that bug needs to fix immediately.

Unfussybull679,"March 22, 2024",There are plenty of things wrong with this app I got to be honest be I can put up all of them but the crashing this app literally crashes on you if you open another app (sometimes even when you close into the home menu) while on call or video call (it's worse when screensharimg) it crashes the UI to which shouldn't and that's the only thing I can't put up tbh,NEGATIVE,0.999505877494812,3.0,SECURITY

Still having the same issues, in preview before sending I can hear it like normal but when I send it to the recipient they can't hear audio and it doesn't save on snap roll.

Živa Pahor,"April 14, 2024","The app is really good. It's easy to use. I really like the whole bitmoji idea and snapping. But it has some flaws, for example the 3D bitmojis that are terrible and I really miss the old ones. I think that spotlight is very unnecessary and it's kinda annoying. The app itself is very useful and i really like it.",POSITIVE,0.9988445043563844,,
