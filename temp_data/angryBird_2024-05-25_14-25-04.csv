L Sherwood,"May 17, 2024","Breaks my heart to give this game 1 star. I have played for years on several devices. Completely addicted. But now, I think I am being forced into the pay to play level. Makes no sense to spend hours/days on one level. The challenge becomes frustration. I was informed all levels can be won w/o boosters, extra plays, coins, but how many attempts does it take? 100's? Thousands? Feels like it."
Damien Bell,"May 2, 2024","Classic game. Came back to it to play for nostalgic reasons. I love how the game is today BUT if you're gonna put pop up windows to advertise new features in the game MAKE SURE YOU PUT A CLOSE BUTTON ON THEM!!! You can play the game but if you get hit with one of these pop up windows you'll have to close the game, and reload it every time! The ads make the game almost unplayable!"
Matt Hays,"May 21, 2024","*** I'm uninstalling this before it causes me to break my phone! I've never played a game with so much potential that pisses me off as much as this one This app is great... EXCEPT: - Too much waiting on levels to come up - WAY too much stuff on screen to play on a phone... Can't see what the heck you're doing!! This was written for a bigger screen. - Energy runs out too fast, given the other two points."
Sj Milburn,"May 18, 2024",Unexpectedly Loved this game but- sometimes there are so many layers of mini games & other stuff that I can't continue...3 layers interfere...I'm trying like hell to get something to work...I'm tapping my fingers off. When everything's in sync it's amazing! What is happening?? Still glitches HELPno one cares...be prepared to spend $$ if you don't want to be stuck on a level for weeks at a time. The mini games are fun though
Allan Beasley,"May 23, 2024","Fun but INFESTED with ads. Now the ads have gotten to 60 seconds long and you could spend 15 minutes watching ads before you start actually playing. I get so burned out on everything depending on watching an ad that I don't really want to play any more after sitting through minute after minute of ads to pick up the bonuses when I log in. Probably just gonna uninstall again. The gameplay is fun, but the ads make it hard to enjoy."
Pamela,"May 2, 2024","I like this game however, it has problems. Mainly freezing up multiple times while playing. Ads also freeze up. Don't upgrade your hatching. I didn't realize I would have to feed it 20 apples everyday and apples are very hard to come by. Newest update is terrible. I have to turn the sound down because the loud la la la song is terrible. Game is still slow and gets stuck on commercials."
Xavier Wagner,"May 16, 2024",I would like to be able to update the game on my LG Stylo 4 when the updates are released so I won't have to worry about bugs and crashes hindering my gameplay experience. I would also like to be able to open the support page without the app crashing and making sending feedback and reporting bugs harder than it needs to be. I would also appreciate it if the gameplay didn't rely on luck all the time. Another instance of crashes is whenever I play the Level Map.
BRET Mayer,"May 2, 2024","Been playing for several years, like others I had to uninstall and reinstall since the last ""upgrade"" screwed things up. Now I can't get my old account back, I lost all my jems, all my pearls, my flock that we just came off a 17 game winning streak gone. This happened years ago and I had to start all over again, not going to do it again!!!! If this can't be resolved simply without jumping through hoops, they lost another long time player!!!"
Karisa Murphy,"May 2, 2024","I used to play this game every day, and I spent a lot of money in the game. Now the game freezes, kicks me out of battles. I dontbget my prizes I paid money for, I don't get the prizes I watched videos for because it freezes. One screen gets frozen over the other and I have to close the app. When I reached out nothing was done, no one assisted me, but I got a notice that they were happy they resolved the issue, when NOTHING was resolved. There are just a ton of glitches."
Ravi,"April 30, 2024","Every other arena match freezes. My arena points are about 200 less than last week, without having lost a single match. Edit : ok, this is getting frustrating. The freezes have increased. Rebooting phone hasn't helped. Just going to have to stop playing till an update comes out. Edit (4/29/24) : Freezing issue seems to have been resolved in the latest update. Was able to do the full arena streak without freezing up."
