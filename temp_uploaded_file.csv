Used to be a great app but there are so many more bugs and issues than ever before. Plus they are ruining their user interface trying to keep up with other social media platforms. Making editing videos in the app extremely infuriating. It's like they try to add all these extra features but don't quite do it in the right way so it actually ends up limiting what you can do.
